# ObscurityOne

Open-source OSINT and security toolkit by **Obscurity Labs** — focused on practical, real-world investigations.

## What it is
ObscurityOne is a growing collection of tools and workflows for:
- OSINT collection and enrichment
- Basic recon and target profiling
- Data parsing, normalization, and reporting
- Utility scripts for common investigative tasks

## Goals
- Simple to run locally
- Clear documentation
- Modular tools (each tool can stand alone)
- Ethical use only

## Status
🚧 Early development — actively building MVP features.

## Roadmap (high-level)
- [ ] Core CLI scaffold
- [ ] First OSINT module (domain / username / email intel)
- [ ] Export results (JSON/CSV)
- [ ] Basic reporting template

## Contributing
PRs are welcome once the first MVP structure is in place.
